# Cloverleaf - Powershell feed example
Please see the powershell file for the complete help information, or via the `get-help` cmdlet to view it in-console.  This includes a variety of samples as well.

# Dependencies
This script uses Powershell 6, which is available for download at [https://aka.ms/pscore6]

# Setup
CLFeedPull.ps1 is fairly standalone; you can place it in any directory you want.  By default, if the `-out` parameter is not specified, the script will create a child directory called "feedRes" under the current script directory and write the feed results there to a filename displayed during execution.
